# PlexDBRepair.sh

Interactive Plex database check/repair script for Linux & Docker (Unraid-friendly).  
Runs **safe, offline** integrity checks using **Plex‚Äôs own SQLite binary**, backs up your DB, offers light repair (REINDEX/VACUUM), can dump/rebuild if corruption is detected, and fixes permissions for common install types.

> üíæ **Safety first:** Every run creates a timestamped backup in `~/plex-db-backups/`.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Works with:
  - **Standard Linux Plex Install** (systemd / bare-metal)
  - **Plex Official Docker** (`plexinc/pms-docker`)
  - **binhex-plex** (popular on Unraid)
  - **Custom Plex Path** (Docker or bare metal)
- Performs **offline** `PRAGMA integrity_check` / `quick_check`
- Optional **REINDEX; VACUUM;** light maintenance
- **Dump & rebuild** path for corrupted DBs
- Fixes ownership/perms:
  - binhex: respects **PUID/PGID**
  - official image: respects **PLEX_UID/PLEX_GID** or host owner
  - bare-metal: uses service user
- Verifies `/config` is **read-write**
- Tails Docker and Plex logs at the end

---

## üì¶ Requirements

- Linux (Unraid or any standard distro)
- `bash`, `docker` (for Docker installs), `systemd` (for bare-metal service control)
- Run as **root** (needed to stop services/containers and fix permissions)

> Why not plain `sqlite3`? Plex uses custom FTS tokenizers/collations. The script uses the **Plex SQLite** binary bundled with Plex to avoid errors like `unknown tokenizer: collating`.

---

## üîß Installation

Save the script as `PlexDBRepair.sh`:

```bash
# In your repo or on the host:
chmod +x PlexDBRepair.sh
```

(If you‚Äôre on Windows, ensure LF line endings.)

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

```bash
sudo ./PlexDBRepair.sh
```

Pick your setup at the menu:

```
Plex DB Repair / Maintenance
Choose your setup:
  1) Standard Linux Plex Install (systemd/bare metal)
  2) Plex Official Docker (plexinc/pms-docker)
  3) binhex-plex (Docker, Unraid)
  4) Custom Plex Path
Enter choice [1-4]:
```

The script will:

1. Stop Plex (service or container)
2. Back up DB files (`com.plexapp.plugins.library.db*`)
3. Run `integrity_check` and `quick_check`
4. Offer light repair (**REINDEX; VACUUM;**)
5. If corruption is detected, offer **dump & rebuild**
6. Fix permissions and verify `/config` mount (Docker)
7. Restart Plex and show recent logs

Backups are stored at:

```
~/plex-db-backups/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS/
```

## üß† What It Touches

- **Database path** (varies by install):
  - Docker: `<CONFIG>/Plex Media Server/Plug-in Support/Databases/com.plexapp.plugins.library.db`
  - Bare-metal: `<CONFIG>/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-in Support/Databases/...`
- **Plex SQLite binary**:
  - Bare-metal: `/usr/lib/plexmediaserver/Resources/Plug-ins-*/Plex SQLite`
  - Docker: auto-copied from the container to `<CONFIG>/databasetools/plex_sqlite` if missing
- **Permissions**:
  - binhex: `chown -R $PUID:$PGID "<CONFIG>/Plex Media Server"`
  - official: `chown -R $PLEX_UID:$PLEX_GID` (or host path owner)
  - bare-metal: chown to service user (e.g., `plex`)
  - Files `*.db{-wal,-shm}` cleaned before restart

---

## üß© Notes for Unraid

- binhex containers typically set `PUID=99`, `PGID=100` (nobody:users). The script detects these.
- Ensure your **appdata** share is writable and not mounted read-only.
- If library updates still stall after a clean DB:
  - Consider bumping inotify watches:

    ```bash
    echo 'sysctl -w fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288' >> /boot/config/go
    # reboot to persist
    ```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **`attempt to write a readonly database`**  
  Ownership/perms wrong after offline work. The script‚Äôs **Fix permissions** step addresses this. Also confirm `/config` is `rw=true`.

- **`unknown tokenizer: collating`**  
  That‚Äôs plain `sqlite3`. Use **Plex SQLite** (the script handles this automatically).

- **Container won‚Äôt restart / config mount is ro**  
  Check the Docker template for a `:ro` on `/config` and remove it. The script prints the RW status.

- **Severe corruption**  
  Use the **dump & rebuild** flow. If the dump fails, you may need table-by-table salvage (open an issue with your logs).

---

## üôã FAQ

- **Is it safe?**  
  Yes. The script **always** makes a timestamped backup before touching your DB.

- **Will it delete my metadata or libraries?**  
  No. It only operates on the Plex library database files and standard temp pages (`-wal`/`-shm`). A dump/rebuild recreates the DB content from your existing DB.

- **Can I run this while Plex is running?**  
  No. It stops Plex to ensure a clean, offline DB.
